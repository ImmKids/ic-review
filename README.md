## Keypoints for IM Theory


`Media` = many; `Medium` = one, something in between.

`IM` is about:
 - creates `context` -> people make `content`, 
 - diff vs `web design` which makes `content`
 - `MOTTO`: `goal of IM`: 
    - LESS ABOUT: `read` `look` `watch` `listen`
    - MORE ABOUT: `write` `draw` `make` `do` `operate` `play` `organize`
 - `code` -> `rules of the environment`

### Canvas VS DOM
Use the `Canvas` for free-form interaction, such as making `art` and `games`.  
The `DOM` is better for displaying and managing `text` and `information`.  
While text can be added to the canvas, itâ€™s not easily `searchable` or `selectable` like in the DOM.  
The DOM excels for `long text`, `scrolling pages`, and `information apps` like social media, forums, and shopping sites.


### 10 usage of canvas (story mode): 
I began by making `Generative Art` for a fun `Game` to teach through `e-Learning`. Then, I improved the `UX/UI` of a `Data Visualization` project, ran some `Interactive Ads`, and created `Interactive Logos` for businesses. Finally, I designed `Puzzles` and `InfoActives` for a festive `Holiday Card`.


### Creator Diagram (formular mode):

**Creator** = `Ideator` && `Maker` && `Developer` &&  `Designer` 

( `I.M.D.D` for short or `DIDM`)


### Conclusion
Each `medium`(`Print`, `Radio`, `TV`, `Web`) has unique factors for effective content. 
Using these factors **advances culture**. 
Traditional media is `authoritative`, but the `Internet` lets users `create` and `communicate`. 
Combine this with `programming` for new `content creation` opportunities.
